When finding a root of a standart square equation is something could be done even by a weak student, a cubic(or equation with higher digree) is a totally diffrent strory. One way around is to guess as many root as possible and break an equation to a square eqution. As instance if we're having a problem of solving f(x, x^2, .. x^n) = a it is possible(with complex numbers) to bring it down
